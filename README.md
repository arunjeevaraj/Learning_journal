# 📚 My Learning Journal

Welcome to my personal learning space! This repository serves as a digital garden where I document my journey, track my progress, and store notes on everything I learn.

## 🚀 Current Focus
- [ ] **Python** (Fixed point implementation of DSP)
- [ ] **DSP** (DSP algorithms and understanding)
- [ ] **Scripting** (TCL, Bash and other automation scripts. )
- [ ] **FPGA implementation** (FPGA design sources and implementation )
- [ ] **ASIC implementation** (ASIC design sources and implementation )

---

## 📂 Directory Structure
- `/python` - Exercises, scripts, and notes in Python targeting DSP applications.
- `/DSP` - block diagrams, details and documentation.
- `/Scripting` - FPGA/ASIC scripts, automations etc.
- `/FPGA implementation` - FPGA design sources and implementation .
- `/ASIC implementation` - ASIC design sources and implementation .
- `/til` - **Today I Learned**: Short, daily bite-sized notes.
- `/resources` - Books, links, and courses I'm following.

## 📈 Contribution Goal
I aim to commit at least **3 times a week** to keep the momentum going!
