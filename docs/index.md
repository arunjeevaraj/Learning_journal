# 📚 My Learning Journal
Welcome to my personal learning space! This repository serves as a digital garden where I document my journey, track my progress, and store notes on everything I learn.
I would like to refer the ever important verse, "Every Journey of thousand miles starts with a single step."
And keep these phrases close to your heart.
>  Enjoy each step, be aware and intentional. Rushing yields no worth.
>  Patience, and relentless effort until everthing moves frictionless.
>  The story you tell yourself becomes the reality you live in.


## 🚀 Current Focus
- [ ] **Python** (Fixed point implementation of DSP)
- [ ] **DSP** (DSP algorithms and understanding)
